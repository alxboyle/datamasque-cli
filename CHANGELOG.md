# Changelog

## v1.1.0

### Added
- `dm catalog` command — emits the full subcommand tree as JSON for agent
  introspection. `--compact` for `{path, help}` only (~1.4kB), default for
  full options/arguments.
- Auto-detection of agent context: output flips to JSON automatically when
  stdout is not a TTY, when `DM_OUTPUT=json` is set, or when the
  vendor-neutral `AI_AGENT` env var is present. `DM_OUTPUT=table` forces
  human output.
- Structured error envelope on stderr in agent mode:
  `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "...", "hint": "..."}}` — stdout
  stays empty on failure so downstream pipes don't trip.

### Changed
- Exit codes are now differentiated by error category. Previously every
  error returned 1; now: `not_found`=3, `invalid_input`=4, `ambiguous`=5,
  `auth_required`=6, `auth_failed`=7, `conflict`=8, `transport_error`=9.
  `error` (unclassified) remains 1; 2 is reserved for typer/click usage
  errors. Stable across minor versions.
- Long values (UUIDs especially) now fold across lines in table output
  rather than being silently truncated with `…` in narrow terminals.

### Internal
- `ErrorCode` and `ConnectionType` are now `StrEnum`s; the abort code arg
  is type-checked at edit time and the connection-type "Valid: ..." hint
  is generated from the enum.
